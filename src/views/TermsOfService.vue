        </p>
        <h3>Disclaimer of Warranties</h3>
        <p>
          Your use of the service is at your sole risk. The service is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. Naativ expressly disclaims all warranties of any kind, whether express, implied or statutory, including, but not limited to the implied warranties or merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement.
        </p>

        <p>
          Certain provisions of the foregoing paragraph may not apply to consumers within the State of New Jersey or in other jurisdictions where prohibited by law.

        </p>
        <h3>Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration</h3>
        <p>
          PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS. Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer’s satisfaction by emailing customer support at <a href="mailto:support@naativ.com">support@naativ.com</a>. In the unlikely event that our customer care team is unable to resolve a complaint you may have (or if Naativ has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration, mediation, or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Arbitration, which is often cheaper, faster and less formal than a lawsuit in court, uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. The payment of attorneys’ fees will be governed by the AAA Rules (as defined below). Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.
        </p>
        <h3>Arbitration Agreement</h3>
        <p>
          Naativ and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;
          </li>
          <li>
            claims that arose before this or any prior agreements (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);
          </li>
          <li>
            claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and
          </li>
          <li>
            claims that may arise after the termination of this Terms of Service.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          References to " Naativ", "you", and "us" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or devices under this or prior agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court. This arbitration agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies, including, for example, the Federal Communications Commission. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into this Terms of Service, you and Naativ are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This Terms of Service evidences a transaction in the interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Terms of Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice"). The Notice to Naativ should be addressed to 7927 S High Point Parkway, #350, Sandy, UT 84094 ("Notice Address"). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). If Naativ and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Naativ may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Naativ or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Naativ is entitled.
        </p>
        <p>
          The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by this Terms of Service, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Terms of Service. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of the arbitration provision. Unless Naativ and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The payment of any fees will be governed by the AAA rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees and expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.
        </p>
        <p>
          The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. YOU AND NAATIV AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Naativ agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notwithstanding any provision in this Terms of Service to the contrary, we agree that if Naativ makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the Naativ Web Site, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.
        </p>
        <h3>Termination</h3>
        <p>
          You agree that Naativ, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or any part thereof) or use of the Service and remove and discard any content within the Service, for any reason, including, without limitation, for lack of use or if Naativ believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms of Service. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of your use of Service, may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities. Naativ may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Service, or any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the Service under any provision of this Terms of Service may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that Naativ may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related information and files in your account and/or bar any further access to such files or the Service. Further, you agree that Naativ will not be liable to you or any third-party for any termination of your access to the Service.

        <h3>User Disputes</h3>
        <p>
          You agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with any other user in connection with the Service and Naativ will have no liability or responsibility with respect thereto.

        </p>
        <h3>General</h3>
        <p>
          These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and Naativ and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Naativ with respect to the Service. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate or third-party services, third-party content or third-party software. These Terms of Service will be governed by the laws of the State of Utah without regard to its conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth above, you and Naativ agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within Salt Lake City, Utah. The failure of Naativ to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. The section titles in these Terms of Service are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Notices to you may be made via either email or regular mail. The Service may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms of Service or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Service.

        <h3>Your Privacy</h3>
        <p>
          At Naativ, we respect the privacy of our users. For details please see our <a href="privacy">Privacy Policy</a>. By using the Service, you consent to our collection and use of personal data as outlined therein.

        <h3>Sales Tax</h3>
        <h3>State & Local Sales Taxes</h3>
        <p>
          Taxes, if any, charged to your credit card will be calculated based on the applicable state and local sales taxes when your order is billed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The terms contained herein are subject to change as the taxation of online transactions is continually evolving. Naativ strives to comply with state and local tax laws as they exist currently, and continues to monitor and update its taxation policies as those laws change.
        </p>
        <p>
          Naativ does not collect sales or use taxes in all states. For states imposing sales or use taxes, your purchase may be subject to use tax unless it is specifically exempt from taxation. Your purchase is not exempt merely because it is made over the Internet or by other remote means. Many states require purchasers to file a sales/use tax return at the end of the year reporting all of the taxable purchases that were not taxed and to pay tax on those purchases. Details of how to report these taxes may be found at the websites of your respective taxing authorities.
        </p>
